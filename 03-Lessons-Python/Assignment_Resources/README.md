# Additional Assistance with the Module 3 Challenge:
  If you feel you need some addition help in completing the Python Assignment (Module 3 Challenge) I have created a video that walks through the following:
* setting up a github repository with necessary folders and files (to include the election_results.csv file and starter code)
* setting up the readme markdown file to include headers and sub headers for analysis (to include images/screen captures saved as .png files)
* evaluating the starter code to ensure the file paths (..to_load and ..to_save) reflect my folder and file structure and confirm I can import the necessary libraries (csv and os) and read in the csv file
* update my PyPoll_Challenge.py file reflect the "Asks" specified in the directions (and included in the comments of the starter code i.e. 4a, 4b, 4c...)
* work to ensure I maintain working code by running my code periodically and checking for correct output (to the terminal and to the election_analysis.txt file) and * making corrections as necessary for any error messages
* performing git add . and git commit -m "update messages" and git push to update my github repository
* update the readme markdown file to ensure I have answered the questions necessary to meet all assignment requirements and perform a final Quality Control (remember you will be sharing this in your portfolio of work with potential employers.

### Note: If you view this video, I expect some type of feedback to this thread in our data-visualization-boot-camp Channel on SLACK to include any corrections, comments, complaints. 
Your feedback will let me know this type of additional support is appreciated and will encourage me to provide additional assistance on future assignments.
Note: this link is not to be shared outside of your class. This is bonus support provided by your instructor and not intended for students in other bootcamps.
