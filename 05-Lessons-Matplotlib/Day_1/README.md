# Day_1 Matplotlib
This week, you will be introduced to Matplotlib, a Python plotting library used to produce publication-quality data visualizations. Matplotlib has a set of features for creating and annotating charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame. You will use Matplotlib to create line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker charts, and also to make them visually compelling and informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors. Youâ€™ll also be introduced to SciPy, a statistical Python package, and NumPy, a fundamental package for scientific computing, to perform summary statistics.

The main focus of today's class is to get you comfortable with creating and annotating line, bar, pie, and scatter charts.

Learning Objectives
By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create line, bar, pie, and scatter charts
* Add and modify chart features
